# Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50
# Note: The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers:
# 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,.....
# Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
# Expected output ; 1 1 2 3  5 8 13 21 34 



a,b = 0,1
while b<=50:
    print(b)
    a,b = b,a+b


# OUTPUT:
# "Fibonacci_series"
# 1
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 8
# 13
# 21
# 34
