# Write a python program to count the numbers of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

# sample numbers : numbers = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

# Expected Output:

# Numbers of even numbers : 5

# Numbers of odd numbers : 4


numbers = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
count_even = 0
count_odd = 0

for x in numbers:
    if x % 2:
        count_even+=1
    else:
            count_odd+=1
print("Number of even numbers:",count_even)
print("Number of odd numbers:",count_odd)



# OUTPUT:

# Number of even numbers: 5
# Number of odd numbers: 4
